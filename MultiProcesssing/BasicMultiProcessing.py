# multiprocessing creates separate processes that each have their own memory space,
#  making it more suitable for CPU-bound operations.

# Multiprocessing is best suited for CPU-intensive tasks, like heavy calculations,
# where you need to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) 
# prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes in parallel, but with multiprocessing,
# each process runs in its own Python interpreter and has its own GIL. 

# Since each process runs independently, you can utilize multiple CPU cores effectively, 
# which can speed up the execution time for certain tasks.
